- 👋 Hi, I’m @elusiveKitten. I am a recovering accountant learning how to code for the first time!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can - everything is interesting and new and I'm not yet sure which direction to take my career in. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning server side API's as a .NET student in Tech Elevator (coding bootcamp).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on side projects and anything that is just-for-fun. 
- 📫 How to reach me - email mckenzietbrb@gmail.com
